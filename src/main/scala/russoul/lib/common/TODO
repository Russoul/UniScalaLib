Priority:
    idea:
        -container representing a reference to some memory area that should be cleaned up manually (i.e direct buffer), throw exception {when??} if the resource is not freed at some point
        -integrate scalafmt
    Errors:
        1)see Mat4 (specialize it !)
    Performance issues:
        //TODO @specialized(Float,Double,Int) leads to performance REGRESS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        //macro for all ops, probably scala meta, NOPE. scala meta wont do, wait for scalamacros/scalamacros (macro lib and plugin depending on scala meta)
        //rectangle2 as (min,max) ?
        //TODO CACHING OF IMPLICITS !!!
        //abstract over shapes ?
        //for now vec,mat and geos are case classes (@specialized(Float,Double,Int) is currently removed), remove case class notation and add custom equals and hashocode method before adding @specialized(Float,Double,Int) back
    High:
        //name abbreviations correctly
        //performant way to represent generic field literals ?
        //string-inter-macro type literals
        //make int a can eu space or think of a better solution to be a able to create say Triangle holding ints
        //make some really powerful macros disabling typechecking(in macros), see c++ like templates project for scala
        //Type everything !
       -3)matrices for 2d transformations
       -1)overriding abstract typeclass method with field for better performance (like 'one' or 'zero') throws runtime exception, why ?
        1)write tests
        2)see if @specialized(Float,Double,Int) is set in all places needed
        3)assertions
        4)//TODO fix Mat.apply calls indexing from 0 but not from 1
        5)make Vec, Mat and other containers be scala friendly(support native operations or
         maybe even extend common types)
    Medium:
        0)write crossplatform rendering library
        1)instantiate typeclass from string at compile time ? or at least at run time
    Low:
        1)prob remove all the inline annotations that are unnecessary(are warned by the compiler as they can not be inlined "-Yinline-warnings")
