Priority:
    Errors:
        1)see Mat4 (specialize it !)
    Performance issues:
        //TODO move geometric objects' implicits from constructors to methods, create implicit groups that group multiple implicits into one + add auto grouping using implicit conversions

        //Each geometric object currently stores implicits as fields (possible solution is abstracting over each shape, like we did with Vec and Mat)
        //lots of object creation when resolving explicits (implicit def ... should be cached for better performance)
    High:
        //name abbreviations correctly
        //performant way to represent generic field literals ?
        //string-inter-macro type literals
        //make int a can eu space or think of a better solution to be a able to create say Triangle holding ints
        //rename Implicits to lowercase and rename Russoul package to lowercase
        //implement mat4 and mat3 using StaticMatrix
        //make some really powerful macros disabling typechecking(in macros), see c++ like templates project for scala
        //Type everything !
        //TODO watch shapeless videos
        //TODO make universal matrix and vector classes (probably use arrays for representation of both) + type-checked sizes
        //the above thing is actually already partially implemented : StaticContainer - it is a one dim vector structure
       -3)matrices for 2d transformations
       -2)TODO Shapeless for statically sized collections and more !!
       -1)overriding abstract typeclass method with field for better performance (like 'one' or 'zero') throws runtime exception, why ?
        0)remove Vec use Array instead !
        1)write tests
        2)see if @tbsp is set in all places needed
        3)assertions
        4)//TODO fix Mat.apply calls indexing from 0 but not from 1
        5)make Vec, Mat and other containers be scala friendly(support native operations or
         maybe even extend common types)
        6)remove shitty column field in Vec, use special container or trait to indicate row vectors, column vectors are default
    Medium:
       -1)make better renderers (RenderXXX), make them inherit common interface, make them smart, rethink whole idea
        0)write crossplatform rendering library
        1)instantiate typeclass from string at compile time ? or at least at run time
    Low:
        1)prob remove all the inline annotations that are unnecessary(are warned by the compiler as they can not be inlined "-Yinline-warnings")
